Creating a simple text editor using JAVA

In this project, I have created a simple text editor that performs the following functions:

    1. Open a saved/new file
    2. Save a file
    3. Cut,copy,paste text
    4. Close
A statusbar is used which displays the no of lines of text in a saved file.

The GUI components are built using the functionalities of javax.swing package.
